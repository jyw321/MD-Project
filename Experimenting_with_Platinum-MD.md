# (still experimenting) Use Platinum-MD to retrieve audio tracks in its original ATRAC format #

The workflow below is still under experimenting. 

[Platinum-MD](https://github.com/gavinbenda/platinum-md.git) is a project aims to make uploading audio files to NetMD players seamless and automatic. It is also a project based on the linux-minidisc codes. Platinum-MD has both GitHub codes and [GUI-software](https://platinum-md.app) for download. Originally, it was designed for uploading audio tracks from local computers to NetMDs without involving any proprietary software such as SonicStage. Lately, [a latest version](https://github.com/.../platinum-md/releases/tag/v1.0.0-RC1) is pre-released, bringing forth a set of new features including compatibility with Hi-MD and allowing uploading audio tracks from MD to computer. 

The tests I made below is based on the latest pre-released v1.0.0-RC1 version.
