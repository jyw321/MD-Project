# Hi-MD #
This is a testing project for retrieving digital contents stored in Hi-MD formatted MiniDiscs and transferring to my local Mac computer. This project is based on the scripts from the [linux-minidisc](https://wiki.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc/doku.php?id=start) and the application tool [QHiMDTransfer](https://wiki.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc/doku.php?id=qhimdtransfer). 

In particular, the application tool QHiMDTransfer is supposed to be a simple clone of the Mac OS X software [HiMD Music Transfer for Mac 2.0](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/downloads/W0002236), which is the Sony software for MiniDisc users to transfer audio information between Hi-MD player and Mac computer. This software was accompanied with a Hi-MD player when a consumer purchases a set of the product. Unfortunately, the original "HiMD Music Transfer" software is only compatible with the Mac OS X version 10.3.9 through 10.4. 

With the development of the [QHiMDTransfer](https://wiki.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc/doku.php?id=qhimdtransfer) project, though still at a rudimentary stage, provides to nowadays MiniDisc users a flexible approach to retrieve the stored information. The QHiMDTransfer application is open-source, compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux systems. This is exceptionally useful to archivists working in cultural institutions.
